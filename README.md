# Decision Tree Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset
This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing techniques and decision tree classification on the Social_Network_Ads dataset. The key steps and objectives include:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables.
Scale/normalize numerical features.
Decision Tree Classification:

Train a decision tree classifier on the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate model performance using:
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Accuracy
Visualization:

Visualize the decision tree structure for better interpretability.
